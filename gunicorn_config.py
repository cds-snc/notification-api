    # The default graceful timeout period for Kubernetes is 30 seconds, so

    # Kubernetes timeout. This ensures that the gunicorn worker will exit
    # before the Kubernetes pod is terminated. This is important because
    # Kubernetes will send a SIGKILL to the pod if it does not terminate
    # within the grace period. If the worker is still processing requests
    # when it receives the SIGKILL, it will be terminated abruptly and
    # will not be able to finish processing the request. This can lead to
    # 502 errors being returned to the client.
    #
    # Also, some libraries might need some time to finish
    # initialization before the worker can start processing requests. The
    # timeout values should consider these factors.
