# Running a Subset of Tests Using Containers

You can run specific test directories, files, or individual tests rather than the entire suite as follows.  These instructions assume that you have previously run the docker-compose command to start the local ecosystem and, therefore, that all migrations have been applied to the database and the default container network, ci_default, exists.

## Setting Environment Variables

The docker-compose command used to run the full test suite sets environment variables.  Step 3 below references the file env_vars for the same purpose.

## Setup

1. Stop all running containers associated with Notification-api.
2. Start the Postgres (ci_db_1) container, and any other containers required by the functionality under test: `docker start ci-db-1`.  All migrations should already be applied.
3. Start a test container shell by running `docker run --rm -it -v "<absolute path to notification-api>:/app" --env-file tests/env_vars --name ci-test ci-test bash`.
4. Add the test container started in the previous step to the default network: `docker network connect ci_default ci-test`.
5. In the test container shell, run `pytest -h` to see the syntax for running tests.  Without flags, you can run `pytest [file or directory]...`.

## Running Individual Tests

This is an example of running a specific test in a test file from *within a test container shell*:

```
$ pytest tests/lambda_functions/va_profile/test_va_profile_integration.py::test_va_profile_cache_exists
```

## A Note About .bash_history

Running Bash commands on a container with read-write access, such as ci_test, will result in the creation of .bash_history in your notification_api/ directory.  That file is in .gitignore.
